## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** : 
```text
  git clone https://github.com/ojas-03/Space-Invaders-Pygame-.git
  cd Space-Invaders-Pygame-
```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   pip install pygame

4. **Add the required asset files to your project directory:**
- `background.png` - Game background image
- `player.png` - Player spaceship sprite
- `enemy.png` - Enemy alien sprite
- `bullet.png` - Bullet sprite
- `ufo.png` - Game icon
- `laser.wav` - Bullet firing sound effect
- `explosion.wav` - Enemy destruction sound effect

### Running the Game
  python main.py
  
## 🎯 How to Play

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ← Left Arrow | Move spaceship left |
| → Right Arrow | Move spaceship right |
| Spacebar | Fire bullets |

### Objective
- Shoot all enemies before they reach your position
- Game ends when any enemy reaches the bottom of the screen
- Earn points for each enemy destroyed

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Resolution**: 800x600 pixels
- **Enemy Count**: 6 enemies with randomized starting positions
- **Collision Distance**: 27 pixels for precise hit detection
- **Player Boundaries**: Movement restricted between 0-736 pixels

```

## 🎨 Game Mechanics

### Enemy Behavior
- Enemies move horizontally across the screen
- When reaching screen edges, enemies drop down and change direction
- Game over triggers when enemies reach Y position > 440

### Collision System
- Uses Euclidean distance formula for precise collision detection
- Collision threshold: 27 pixels between bullet and enemy centers

### Bullet System
- Single bullet system with "ready" and "fire" states
- Bullet resets when reaching top of screen or hitting an enemy

## 🔧 Customization Options

```text
Easily modify these variables in `main.py`:
num_of_enemies = 6 # Number of enemies
playerX_change = 5 # Player movement speed
enemyX_change = # Enemy horizontal speed range
bulletY_change = 5 # Bullet speed
enemyY_change = 20 # Enemy drop distance
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- Single bullet at a time
- No multiple lives system
- No increasing difficulty levels

### Planned Features
- [ ] Multiple bullets
- [ ] Power-ups and special weapons
- [ ] Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- [ ] High score persistence
- [ ] Background music integration
